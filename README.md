* The current day will be displayed at the top of the calendar
* When scrolling down, the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours (9a -5p)
* User will have the ability to view the timeblocks for that day
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* The user has the ability to click into a timeblock and enter an event
* The user has the option to save content through a button for a timeblock
* The entry for that timeblock is saved in local storage
* The user has the option see saved events when the browser is refreshed

One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio. You should also add one or two of your Challenge assignments that you are proud of. Remember that the solution code that you received for your Module 2 Challenge gives you a professional template for a portfolio. You should also feel free to create one on your own as you complete this course.

Make sure that your portfolio includes the following:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn page, as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume

* A list of projects, each including the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * Screenshot of the deployed application

Your site should also look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Professional Materials

You should also take time to update your professional materials, including the following:

* GitHub profile

* Resume

* LinkedIn profile

### Update Your GitHub Profile

If you haven't yet, now is the time to update the following in your GitHub profile:

* Profile picture

* Bio

* Location

* Email

* Link to your portfolio

Employers (and potential collaborators) will look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward!

You’ll also want to pin some repos that you want to highlight. To do this, navigate to GitHub, go to your profile, and do the following:

* Click "Customize your pins".

* Click the checkboxes for your project and two to three homework assignments that you would like to share.

* Make sure each of these projects is deployed, and add a link to the deployed project in the README file.

* Follow your classmates. They are the beginning of your professional network, and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is about writing code.

### Update Your Resume

Submit a clear, concise, and compelling resume, tailored to the type of job you’re looking for.

### Update Your LinkedIn Profile

Update your LinkedIn Profile with a strong bio statement, a professional photo, and links to your Github profile and portfolio.

### Prepare for the Technical Interview

Many companies use algorithm questions during the technical interview. We strongly recommend that you practice these. Doing so will prepare you to handle some of the most common questions in an interview or promotion discussion.

Please refer to the class repository to find these algorithms:

* Coding Algorithm #1: Reverse No Built In

* Coding Algorithm #2: Reverse In Place

* Coding Algorithm #3: Look Say Sequence

* Coding Algorithm #4: Is Numeric
